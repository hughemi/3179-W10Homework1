            <h2>A birds-eye view of COVID-19 double vaccination vates across the globe</h2>
            <p>Here we see a choropleth map of double COVID-19 vaccination rates for most countries.
                <br><br> It seems that the higher income countries have better rates which is intuitive since they would 
                have more access to vaccinations.
                Africa is clearly struggling and may be continent the holds the world back from fully opening borders?
                <br><br> Further editing needs to be done to this map to make it potentially interactive so we can zoom 
                in on certain continents, especially South-East Asia and most of Europe. 
                Finer details will be also added for the final assignment.

            <h2>Well are vacciantions rates at least increasing across the world?</h2>
            <p>This chart is overwhelming and largely uninterpretable without any filters applied to it. 
                <br><br> Therefore, I would suggest to play with the 'Region' attribute through either clicking on 
                the legend, or using the 'Region Selection'.
                <br><br> The population filter allows you to look at larger population countries if you wish.
                <br><br> Whilst the 'Rank filter' may be the most interesting. Move the slider and see what you think it means.
                A countries Rank was determined by ranking each countries most recent Double Vaccination %.
                <br><br> The country that ranks 1st and dominates the rest of the world is Gibraltar,
                and no their data is not lying, they really do have a vaccination rate of 117%.
                This is because Gibraltar is a tiny country situated next to Spain, so many Spaniards got vaccinated in Gibraltar and boosted their numbers!
                <br><br> On another note, Africa is clearly struggling with vaccinations rates less than 1% in some countries.
